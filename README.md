# NETAssembly-Cryptography
## Overview
This repository provides implementation of cryptographic algorithms in MATLAB, using net.addAssembly function to integrate .NET assemblies. This enables the use of robust encryption and hashing methods such as AES, RSA, and SHA.
## Features
1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Symmetric key encryption algorithm for secure data encryption and decryption.
2. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Asymmetric key encryption algorithm
3. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms): Cryptographic hash functions
